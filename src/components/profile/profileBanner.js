            Sooo..... you want to learn a little about me? <br />
            <br /> Well my name is{" "}
            <span className="semi-bold"> Akram Khalid</span>, and here are
            somethings I do during the week, I workout, hike, run, dance
            horribly to music in my house, read, recently started to skate
            (ouch), record YouTube Videos, play basketball 🏀 and swim. I might
            be missing a few things but I really live an active lifestyle. Wanna
            ever chat about code, design, life or even F1 🏎️? Feel free to reach
            me on any of my socials @wrongakram or email me: wrongakram@gmail.
            <br />
            <br />
            Take care
